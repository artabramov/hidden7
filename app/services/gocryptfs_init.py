# NOTE (ADR-09): Gocryptfs passphrase is protected by master password.
# It is encrypted with a master password and is never persisted in
# plaintext on disk. The passphrase exists in plaintext only in memory
# during mount and is discarded immediately afterwards. Access to the
# encrypted data therefore requires both the passphrase and the master
# password.

# TODO: Re-check cipherdir/passphrase/fernet under the WRITE lock
# before creating artifacts. Two concurrent init requests can both
# pass the outer gates; the second may then overwrite secrets after
# the first has already completed successfully.
