# NOTE (ADR-04): gocryptfs passphrase is protected by master password.
# It is encrypted with a master password and is never persisted in
# plaintext on disk. The passphrase exists in plaintext only in memory
# during mount and is discarded immediately afterwards. Access to the
# encrypted data therefore requires both the passphrase and the master
# password.

# NOTE (ADR-05): gocryptfs passphrase is provided throught tmpfs.
# Command-line arguments and stdin are avoided to prevent exposure
# in process listings (argv) and to bypass TTY-based input behavior.
# The passphrase is written to a temporary file in tmpfs (/dev/shm)
# and passed using -passfile. The file exists only for the duration
# of the mount operation and is removed immediately after use.

# NOTE (ADR-06): Cipherdir initialization is a one-time operation.
# The service creates the gocryptfs filesystem and all related secrets
# together. This operation is not transactional, so on failure the
# service performs best-effort cleanup of artifacts created during
# the current attempt.
